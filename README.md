# ðŸŒŸ ROSTAR â€“ Smart Duty Roster Scheduling

Hello, family! ðŸ‘‹

Rostar is a program designed to simplify duty roster creation, reducing bias and saving time.

## ðŸš€ About the Project

- Built with Python, this program efficiently generates duty rosters.
- It consists of two core files:
  - roster.py â€“ Contains the scheduling algorithm.
  - rosterfeed.py â€“ Defines the required data format for the algorithm.
- Useful for learning data science while also being practical for real-world roster management.
  
## ðŸŽ¯ Why Use Rostar?

- âœ… Reduces Bias â€“ Ensures fair duty distribution.
- âœ… Time-Saving â€“ Automates scheduling efficiently.
- âœ… Educational â€“ A great way to explore algorithmic problem-solving in data science.
